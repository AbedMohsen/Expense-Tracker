# Expense Tracker

## Description

This React app allows users to create and manage their expenses. It allows them to enter a title, amount, and date for each expense entry, which are then added to the list of expenses. Additionally, users can utilize a dynamic filled chart to filter expenses by year and view the expense volume for each month.
